        <h2>Back-End Server</h2>

        <h3>Describe the REST API endpoints that your team agreed to implement. If this deviates significantly from class discussion,
            explain why.</h3>
        <div class="answer">We decided to implement the same REST routes as discussed in class, which includes two GET routes
        for all messages as well as individual messages, a POST route for adding a new message to the database, and two
        PUT routes for likes and dislikes.</div>

        <h3>Describe the Data Model that your team agreed to implement. If this deviates significantly from class discussion,
            explain why.</h3>
        <div class="answer">We used the same data model as discussed in class. The frontend sends data to the backend
        using a JSON string, and the backend processes that data and sends the result back using the routes described above.</div>

        <h3>Does the back-end match the description above? Why or why not?</h3>
        <div class="answer">The backend was designed with the description above in mind, and is formatted as such. It does not,
        however, work.</div>

        <h3>Is the back-end code appropriately organized into files / classes / packages?</h3>
        <div class="answer">Aside from various issues with Git, the backend is appropriately organized.</div>

        <h3>Are variables, functions, classes and packages named well?</h3>
        <div class="answer">Yes, everything is named well, and names correspond to the actual function of the variable/method/class</div>

        <h3>Are the dependencies in the pom.xml file appropriate? Were there any unexpected dependencies added to the program?</h3>
        <div class="answer">The dependencies include junit for testing, spark for backend-frontend communication, mysql for connecting
        to the database, and gson for creating JSON strings. No unexpected dependencies were added.</div>

        <h3>What was the biggest issue that came up in code review of the back-end server?</h3>
        <div class="answer">The backend runs into errors when trying to connect to the database.</div>

        <h3>What technical debt do you see in the current back-end server implementation?</h3>
        <div class="answer">It does not work as intended, which will cause a lot of headache in future parts.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="dark">
        <h2>Web Front-End</h2>

        <h3>Is the build and deploy process appropriate for the web front-end?</h3>
        <div class="answer">Yes, the build and deploy process is appropriate.</div>

        <h3>What benefits did you observe on account of the use of TypeScript?</h3>
        <div class="answer">Typescript is useful because it shows compiler errors when we make typos. This makes it
        much easier to debug our code because we do not have to spend hours searching for a misplaced bracket
        or semicolon. The inclusion of data types beyond simple "var"s also makes Typescript more powerful and easier to
        implement.</div>

        <h3>How was the user interface designed? Why did the team settle on the design that is present in the code?</h3>
        <div class="answer">The interface is a vertical list of messages. The user can like or dislike messages using a 
        radial button, and the number of likes/dislikes is displayed on the page. In the upper left corner of the page, 
        a user can add a title/message and post it to the list.</div>

        <h3>Is the web front-end appropriately organized into files / classes / packages?</h3>
        <div class="answer">Within the source directory, we have an index.html file as well as a style.css file. Also, 
        we have a raven.ts (TypeScript) file that compiles into a JavaScript file: raven.js. Finally we have a package.json
        that handles dependencies. </div>

        <h3>Are variables, functions, classes and packages named well?</h3>
        <div class="answer">Files are named using standard HTML/CSS syntax. Variable and function names are logical and
        representative of their purposes.</div>

        <h3>Are the dependencies in the package.json file appropriate? Were there any unexpected dependencies added to the program?</h3>
        <div class="answer">The package.json file contains all of the default dependencies. No unexpected dependencies had to be added.</div>

        <h3>What was the biggest issue that came up in code review of the web front-end?</h3>
        <div class="answer">We are still having issues with connecting the web front end to the backend database and
        managing the dependencies between them.</div>

        <h3>What technical debt do you see in the current web front-end implementation?</h3>
        <div class="answer">The frontend does not properly connect to the database, which will be a serious problem moving forward.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="light">
        <h2>Android App</h2>

        <h3>What difficulties arose during the conversion from ListView to RecyclerView?</h3>
        <div class="answer">The biggest mistake we made was doing the initial programming in Listview and later converting
        to RecyclerView. We thought that it would be a simple translation, but it actually required a complete reworking of
        the main activity class.</div>

        <h3>Are the mechanisms for moving among Activities satisfactory and appropriate?</h3>
        <div class="answer">We believe so. We used a Datum Adapter to allow us to move between the main activity, the compose
        screen, and the read screen. We also implemented a Parcelable object, which will make it easier to move data from
        one activity to another.</div>

        <h3>Describe any significant deviations from the UI design discussed in class.</h3>
        <div class="answer">The general UI design is relatively unchanged from that discussed in class. We have a list of
        messages, with an add button at the bottom and separate activities for viewing and composing messages. We used a linear
        layout to display messages.</div>

        <h3>Is the android app appropriately organized into files / classes / packages?</h3>
        <div class="answer">We have three activities and one adapter with a nested viewholder class within it. All
        variables and functions have appropriate names that accurately correspond to their purposes.</div>

        <h3>Are variables, functions, classes and packages named well?</h3>
        <div class="answer">Yes, everything is appropriately named and makes sense.</div>

        <h3>Are the dependencies in the build.gradle file appropriate? Were there any unexpected dependencies added to the program?</h3>
        <div class="answer">The only dependency added aside from the default was one that allowed us to implement RecyclerView
        and one for android:support
        </div>

        <h3>What was the biggest issue that came up in code review of the android app?</h3>
        <div class="answer">Overall, the android app works as intended, but this is after a major retooling trying to switch
        from listview to recyclerview. Additionally, there is a potential issue where the app may not run properly without
        a "draft" folder. This will likely not be a problem, but the draft folder has been added to the repository just in case.</div>

        <h3>What technical debt do you see in the current android app implementation?</h3>
        <div class="answer">We had to deal with our own technical debt when we had to convert from ListView to RecyclerView
        at the end. This required much more work than we had anticipated.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="dark">
        <h2>Unit Tests</h2>

        <h3>Are the unit tests for the back-end server complete/satisfactory? If yes, why do you have confidence in your answer.
            If not, what's missing?</h3>
        <div class="answer">Unit tests for the backend offer complete code covererage, but do not tackle edge cases or
        exceptions.</div>

        <h3>Are the unit tests for the web front-end complete/satisfactory? If yes, why do you have confidence in your answer.
            If not, what's missing?</h3>
        <div class="answer">Unit tests for the front end test for whether a message is being shown, and whether an alert
        is being triggered, but does not test for the REST routes.</div>

        <h3>What challenges did you observe in the way that the web front-end is being tested? Is Jasmine providing satisfactory
            code coverage?</h3>
        <div class="answer">Jasmine was very challenging because none of us had ever used it before, and it is difficult
        to specify specifically what we need to test on the front end.</div>

        <h3>What challenges did you observe on account of the relationship between the database and the server? Was mocking used
            to separate tests? Why or why not?</h3>
        <div class="answer">Testing the backend required absolute knowledge of all the technologies, lamdas, and methods that
        the backend developer was using, down to the names of the individual functions and what parameters were passed.
        We would have loved to implement mocking to be able to more easily test the backend, but were simply unable to figure out
        how to do so.</div>

        <h3>What was the biggest issue that came up in code review of the testing?</h3>
        <div class="answer">The biggest issue with our tests is a general disconnect between the tests and the backend/frontend
        code that they are supposed to be unit testing. This was made much worse because extenuating circumstances meant
        the tester could not meet with the rest of the team during the last several days of the project.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="light">
        <h2>Project-Wide</h2>

        <h3>Were any difficulties encountered when generating documentation for the Java and TypeScript code?</h3>
        <div class="answer">Not particularly. The JavaDoc tool in IntelliJ was not as straightforward to use
        as we had hoped, though.</div>

        <h3>Were there any issues with the use of git for source control?</h3>
        <div class="answer">We have experienced a lot of issues with team members accidentally committing to multiple branches
        or generally committing files that they didn't mean to commit, and not knowing how to remove them from the repository.
        As a result we have a lot of redundancy and some files (such as the jasmine tests) are hard to find deep within
        unintuitive file structures. </div>

        <h3>Were there any team issues that arose?</h3>
        <div class="answer">Aside from a general lack of understanding of many of the parts and how they are supposed to
        work together, no. Overall coordination and planning has leaved much to be desired, especially when the tester
        had to leave the state for a family emergency and couldn't meet for the last several days of the project.</div>

        <h3>How did the amount of time your teammates spent compare to the amount of time you thought the tasks would take?</h3>
        <div class="answer">We expected to spend a very long time staring at our computers having no idea what to do, and
        that's exactly what happened.</div>

        <h3>Describe the most significant obstacle or difficulty your team faced.</h3>
        <div class="answer">The most significant obstacle we faced was getting the backend and frontend to communicate with one
        another. Additionally, it was very very difficult to have full and complete test coverage because the tester was
        unable to meet with the rest of the group in person due to outstanding circumstances.</div>

        <h3>What is your biggest concern as you think ahead to the next phase of the project?</h3>
        <div class="answer">Our biggest concern is that our issues with frontend/backend communication will hold us back
        and make it difficult to move forward with the next steps of the project. Additionally, our git/file system is a
        bit of a disaster, as no one really knows which files are supposed to go where.</div>
