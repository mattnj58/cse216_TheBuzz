        <h2>Back-End Server</h2>

        <h3>Describe the REST API endpoints that your team agreed to implement. If this deviates significantly from class discussion,
            explain why.</h3>
        <div class="answer">The REST API endpoints that my team agreed to implement is the same API as the one 
		discussed in class and continues with the previous API as phase1. The new REST API now includes
		a post route for username and password authentication, a post route for creating a message, a post route for 
		upvoting and down voting a message or comment</div> 

        <h3>Describe the Data Model that your team agreed to implement. If this deviates significantly from class discussion,
            explain why.</h3>
        <div class="answer">Again, we used teh same data model that was agreed in class. Here we create a token for authentication that 
		checks if the user is in the database and each route checks for that token without having the user to input his/her 
		password everytime the webpage access another route</div>

        <h3>Is the back-end code appropriately organized into files / classes / packages?</h3>
        <div class="answer">The back-end code is appropriately organized into files that is approapriately named 
		so that later users can understand what that file is about.</div>

        <h3>Are the dependencies in the pom.xml file appropriate? Were there any unexpected dependencies added to the program?</h3>
        <div class="answer">All the dependencies in the pom.xml file was expected, nothing was suddenly added that 
		seemed out of nowhere.</div>

        <h3>What was the biggest issue that came up in code review of the back-end server?</h3>
        <div class="answer">The biggest issure that came up in the code review, was that there were still errors 
		when connecting to the database.</div>

        <h3>What technical debt do you see in the current back-end server
         implementation?</h3>
        <div class="answer">The technical debt I see in the current back-end server is that we still don't know how to 
		connect our program to the database along with the other roles. This could blow up in our faces unless we find a way
		to fix this problem</div>
        
        <h3>Describe any refactoring that was performed to reduce technical
        debt from the last phase</h3>
        <div class="answer">Somethings that were done to reduce technical debt was to improve all the back-end 
		routes so that it can be easily understood and can could help with fixing the connection to the database
		the in the future</div>
    </div>

    <div class="dark">
        <h2>Web Front-End</h2>

        <h3>Were there any difficulties with using Bootstrap?</h3>
        <div class="answer">I found bootstrap very easy to implement and use. It is almost too simple. 
Sometimes I felt it didn't provide quite enough room for creativity and
custimizability but this made it very easy to use.</div>

        <h3>What patterns are employed in the web front-end to make the code
        more maintainable?</h3>
        <div class="answer">By seperating the .hb format files from the typescript, and the HTML files, 
the code was seperated well. A change to something like the nav bar carries
across the views with ease and any changes within each view do not effect 
the other views.</div>

        <h3>How was the user interface designed? Why did the team settle on the design that is present in the code?</h3>
        <div class="answer">The design we chose reflected a similar format to the android app and is based
around simplicity. We found that using things like pop up windows where cleaner
and required less code than creating a new view. For example, when you click
on a author of a coment, their profile comes up as a modal. This keeps all the
actions within the same read class.</div>

        <h3>Is the web front-end appropriately organized into files / classes / packages?</h3>
        <div class="answer">The web front end is approapriately organized, reflecting the effective model
used in the phase 2 web tutorial. Any changes made to specific classes remain
local, and any changes to things like the nav bar are universal.</div>

        <h3>Are the dependencies in the package.json file appropriate? Were there any unexpected dependencies added to the program?</h3>
        <div class="answer">I tried to limmit the amount of dependencies, however I did have to add a few 
dependencies for bootstrap, such as creating editable text.
</div>

        <h3>What was the biggest issue that came up in code review of the web front-end?</h3>
        <div class="answer">By far the bigest issue with the web front end was connecting to the database. 
At the time of this interview, I have yet to connect. This was caused by a 
lack of communication between myself and Ben, who did the backend. He was on
Spring Break this past week, and I failed to get far enough in the web front 
end to work with him on combining the two, despite him making me well aware 
that he would be unable to work over break. I hope to make up for this when 
I return from break to support the next web developer</div>

        <h3>What technical debt do you see in the current web front-end implementation?</h3>
        <div class="answer">The bigest technical debt is in the database connection. Even if I do get it 
working soon, it will be rushed and could have some flaws. I am leaving good
comments to declare where these shortfalls occor and i will work with the next
web developer to make up for this. It would be good for me to do backend next 
so I work closer with whoever this is</div>
    </div>

    <div class="light">
        <h2>Android App</h2>

        <h3>What difficulties arose when using Volley?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
		Will had a ton of trouble connecting the app to the backend and using the database. 
		For example sending Json object with POSTs to post a new message never seemed to work and he is not sure if thatâ€™s a problem with his code(most likely)
		or the backend code, or both. </div>

        <h3>Describe any significant deviations from the UI design discussed in class.</h3>
        <div class="answer"> Everything is pretty muc hthe same, there is a welcome screen where users can select to login or 
		signup. If the login they are directed to a screen to enter their username and apssword and when they sign in, they are taken to the 
		feed where they can post and read messages. For simplicity sakes, we decided to take away the ability to like messages from the feed.
		To create an account, a suser give their email and should be sent a username and password and they should be added to the database
		and be given the ability to login.</div>

        <h3>Is the android app appropriately organized into files / classes / packages?</h3>
        <div class="answer"> All the activities (compose,login,signup... etc) are in a java folder. All the xml documents with the supporting
		design of the activities are in the layout folder and the maniffest is separate.
		</div>

        <h3>Are the dependencies in the build.gradle file appropriate? Were there any unexpected dependencies added to the program?</h3>
        <div class="answer"> Added the dependency for Volley and needed the dependeency for the recycleview.</div>

        <h3>What was the biggest issue that came up in code review of the android app?</h3>
        <div class="answer">Connecting to the backend. Obviously that includes many sub-issues including issues with heroku, and the bitbucket
		being a mess so it wasn't easy to look at the code for the backend and build based off of that.</div>

        <h3>What technical debt do you see in the current android app implementation?</h3>
        <div class="answer">The project is still called phase0.erv318(from evan) so that may be a problem in the future. People
		after me will have to fix up the code for connecting to the database and registering users becuaes that ended up with a lot of problems.
		I think the layout of the app and the files are straightforward enough so that people after me will be able to pick up and quickly find where
		the problems are.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="dark">
        <h2>Unit Tests</h2>

        <h3>Are the unit tests for the back-end server complete/satisfactory?
            If yes, why do you have confidence in your answer.  If not,
            what's missing?</h3>
        <div class="answer">We have comprehensive unit testing for each of the backend classes, 
		however we are still struggling to figure out how to properly implement and test the REST 
		routes. As such, these are likely not tested as completely as they should be.</div>

        <h3>Are the unit tests for the web front-end complete/satisfactory?
            If yes, why do you have confidence in your answer.  If not,
            what's missing?</h3>
        <div class="answer">Unit tests for the front end are not satisfactory because I am still very confused 
		about how to implement Jasmine tests and when to do so. Once again, we are having trouble with 
		testing the REST routes from both ends, and testing the handlebars and UI is either extremely 
		difficult or impossible.</div>

        <h3>Are the unit tests for the android app complete/satisfactory? If
            yes, why do you have confidence in your answer.  If not, what's
            missing?</h3>
        <div class="answer">No, the unit tests for the android app are not complete 
		because we have donâ€™t know how to connect the app to our database. 
		I attempted to test the activities and transitions between them but 
		the tests are definitely not complete.</div>
        
        <h3>What non-unit testing was performed?</h3>
        <div class="answer">I attempted to utilize instrumented testing for android 
		and acceptance tests for testing the connection between the web 
		front end and the database.</div>

        <h3>What difficulties arose due to the use of Espresso?</h3>
        <div class="answer">Espresso is extremely difficult to learn, especially as I have no experience using android outside of phase 0. 
		Add onto this the difficulty of implementing the database connection as well as authorization, and our 
		technical debt far, far outweighs our liabilities as far as testing is concerned.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="light">
        <h2>Project-Wide</h2>

        <h3>How well did your team estimate effort?</h3>
        <div class="answer">Our team estimated that the project will take the majority of our time and 
		effort to learn everything that the previous programmer did and how to continue from where they left off
		Therefore, our conclusion that it would take the majority of our time was correct. But even though
		we correctly estimated the effort needed, I belive that we still didn't have enough time to finish properly
		finish our part.</div>

        <h3>What techniques (team programming, timelines, group design
        exercises) did you use to mitigate risk?</h3>
        <div class="answer">In order to mitigate the risk of this problem, we assigned people who were
		working closely together with each other in phase1. This is because it makes their jobs much easier
		because they understand what each other was trying to do with their code. Therefore, they can easily write code
		that works well with each other. Another thing we did to minimize the risk is to meet with the group early and 
		assign roles early so that we can all have as much time as possible to work on the project..</div>

        <h3>Were there any team issues that arose?</h3>
        <div class="answer">As a group, we worked very well together and are having no problems working together effectivly.
		If any of us needed any clarification on a part, the person from the previous phase was more than happy to help clear
		any confusion that was created.</div>

        <h3>Describe the most significant obstacle or difficulty your team
        faced.</h3>
        <div class="answer">The most significant obstacle that our team faces is the fact that we are not sure how to connect the 
		web-end, android, and the backend together. This problem has been plaquing us since the beginning and still continues to
		to haunt us since we aren't able to truly test whether or not the code we wrote actually does what is intended. This is doesn't
		affect the tester as much but still has a significant impact on him.</div>

        <h3>What is your biggest concern as you think ahead to the next phase
        of the project?</h3>
        <div class="answer">As we think ahead to the next phase, the biggest concern that I have is the 
		problem that I am very concerned about is the fact that nobody knows how to implement the 
		database with all the other roles in the project</div>
